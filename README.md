# My dotfiles for OSX

Installation
========
Copy and paste, script coming soon(ish)

Setup
========
* iTerm2
* Sublime Text for projects and Vim for smaller changes
* Fish as a shell (fallback to zsh if POSIX-compatibility needed)
 
Notes
========
* For .fish use oh-my-fish for the plugins and least hassle with rvm and such
* For .vim make sure to install vundle first
* Powerline enabled font required, Meslo 14pt for Powerline preferred
